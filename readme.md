# Professional JavaScript Course -- [See course here](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-javascript)

**You can find the final code for each video in the project folders**. Use that if you get stuck. There is also a bugs file, a slides file and a readme file (you're reading it right now).

## Something is not working! What should I do?

Follow these steps:

1. Check if you made any typos. Also, check your terminals (if we're using those in the videos) to see if there are errors, fix those and try again. This will fix your issue 99% of the time so make sure you've done this thoroughly.
2. Still not working? Check the file in this repo called 'bugs' and see if your problem is present and follow the steps there.
3. Still not working? Copy and paste the final code of the video you're stuck at (you can find the final code in the project folders). If you change the **package.json** file, run the command `npm install` to make sure you have the correct dependencies installed.
4. Still not working? Please ask the question in the Q&A section with a clear description of what's not working. I will help you as quickly as I can. But from my experience: the vast majority of your problems will be because of typos / simple mistakes.

I'm online throughout most of the day and will help you as quickly as I can! In the meantime, I apologize for the inconvenience. Sometimes things break after recording the videos, but I try to be quick with any bugs that come up.

## How can I contact you?
