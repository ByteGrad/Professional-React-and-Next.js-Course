# Professional React & Next.js Course -- [See course here](https://bytegrad.com/courses/professional-react-nextjs)

**Welcome to the course!**. Here, you can find all the resources you will need.

## Something is not working! What should I do?

Follow these steps:

1. Check if you made any typos. Also, check the browser console and terminals (if we're using those in the videos) to see if there are errors, fix those and try again. This will fix your issue 99% of the time so make sure you've done this thoroughly.
2. Still not working? Copy and paste the final code of the project for the files you're stuck at. If you change the **package.json** file, run the command `npm install` to make sure you have the correct dependencies installed.
3. Still not working? Please open an issue in this GitHub repository or submit a message in chat with a clear description of what's not working, ideally with screenshots of your code and error messages. I will help you as quickly as I can. But from my experience: the vast majority of your problems will be because of typos / simple mistakes.

I'm online throughout most of the day and will help you as quickly as I can! In the meantime, I apologize for the inconvenience. Sometimes things break after recording the videos, but I try to be quick with any bugs that come up.

## How can I contact you?
